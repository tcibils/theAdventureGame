Yet another tentative of building a cool game on my led matrix =)

h2. Game Story
Chip, the player, is lost away in an old Romanian forrect. He's away from his home, and wants to get back where his preferd cookies are.

In order to do so, he should pickup the 8 Rose Relics, in order to open the Portal, which will bring him back there.

What Chip doesn't know is that he'll find tons of weird stuff in the Romanian forrest - which can be home of various dangers...

h2. Technical layout
The player is dropped in a gigantic map, stored in the Flash memory, with small visibility around him, which is the actual display.

h3. Tutorial
At the start, the player simply moves around on a dangerless, straight map. He then finds the first Rose Relic, that he can pick up. (i need to learn how to make that buzzer work to give some feedback to the player...)

h3. Early game


h3. Late game
As the player picks the 5th Rose Relic, ennemies become harder to doge or kill.

h3. End game
Once all relics are picked up, the player needs to get to the map center, to enter the portal, and get home, to eat the best cookies in the word again.

h2. Future Development ideas
 * Get inspiration from Chips Challenge (Matteo idea)
 * Code various IA to keep things not fully preditable for the player
 * Maybe even make the player able to make ennemies friends for a short time or something?
